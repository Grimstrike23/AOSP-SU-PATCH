Note:

device tree patches are required, this patch includes such for Nexus 6.
Missing file is the actual su binary, generated from source as follows;
https://github.com/phhusson/Superuser/commit/de6eff7c5ef3b64dde4dc5f85cd89dadddac273a
** copy the su binary into device/moto/shamu/

Also note that this patch places selinux into permissive mode. This is only
TEMPORARY until the sepolicy can be worked out further.

Apply this patch to AOSP sources initialized to android-6.0.0_r1 release tag.
Generate boot.img using "make bootimage".


In our very secure consideration, it is safer to run with selinux in permissive mode, than to grant root privileges to a binary executable that is under the
control of a legal entity whose motives are unknown.
